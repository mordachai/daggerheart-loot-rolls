# Daggerheart Loot Rolls

A simple module for Foundry VTT v13 that rolls results from **Loot** and **Consumables** tables for the Daggerheart system.

It adds a new group in the **Scene Controls** called **Daggerheart Tools**, with two buttons:

* Loot Tables
* Consumables Tables

Each opens a dialog where you choose rarity (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Legendary), select dice, and get a chat result with item info and a drag-and-drop UUID.

---

## Recommended

Install [Daggerheart Extra Content](https://github.com/brunocalado/daggerheart-extra-content).
It provides ready-to-use Loot and Consumables tables. No import needed, only the module installed.

In the module settings you can paste any table UUID from any compendium and it should work fine.

---

## Installation

1. In Foundry VTT, go to **Add-on Modules** → **Install Module**
2. Paste this Manifest URL:

   ```
   https://github.com/mordachai/daggerheart-loot-rolls/raw/main/module.json
   ```
3. Install and enable under **Manage Modules**

---

## Usage

Open **Daggerheart Tools** in the scene controls, pick Loot or Consumables, choose rarity and dice, and roll.

---

Want me to also shrink the **Usage** section to a single sentence (“Open Daggerheart Tools, pick a table, roll, see results in chat”), or keep it as is?
